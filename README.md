# DroneDeploy PDF Generator
This is an application built for DroneDeploy's web platform that allows a user to generate a PDF of the current map on the page.

## Dependencies
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) 3.1.1
- [jsPDF](https://parall.ax/products/jspdf) 1.3.2

## Setup
- Fork and clone the repo.
- Upload the folder to the "App Zone" on DroneDeploy's web platform.
- Press the button.
- Enjoy your map.

## Troubleshooting
- Make sure you upload your own example map. Otherwise, you won't be able to access the map image tiles! Instructions for the process can be found [here](http://developer.dronedeploy.com/applications).
- If the image takes a while to download, give it a sec. The proxy server just needs to wake up.

## Resources
- The use of the proxy server for cross-origin requests inspired by [cors-anywhere](http://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/).
